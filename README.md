# MakeMyGift
Flowers and Cakes are one of the oldest forms of gift giving. However, in today’s technological age, it seems archaic that this instrument of happiness is still limited by the constrains of brick and mortar sphere. 

Makemygift allows you to choose your gift from a wide variety of cakes and flowers, and send them to anyone you want. This revolutionary extension of gift giving removes the need for you to physically travel to the store or make a call. Instead, use Makemygift to:

## Steps
Step 1: Select the area you want the gift to be delivered to 
Step 2: Choose you gift from a wide selection 
Step 3: Review your basket and add a personal touch
Step 4: Enter the address of your choice
Step 5: Choose payment method, whether is cash on delivery or online payment 

And you’re done! All you need to do is wait for the order to be delivered and get a personal message from the ‘Giftee’ , all now possible and super easy. Thanks to Makemygift.

But we aren’t done yet, the application also has points system that rewards you for referrals you make. Simply use your current phone number as a referral ID, tell you friends and family to download and enter your referral code and watch how both of you get rewarded with points, and of course we reward you with points for carrying out transactions with us too! Rack up as many points as you can because you’ll soon be able to buy products off a very popular online retailer who sport the colors of white and yellow, and we think you know who we are talking about.
